I was going to ask this in a web development forum, but I realized that this may be an autism issue rather than a programming one. Well, technically, I think it's an executive function issue, but I get my EF problems from my autism.

I'll probably have to touch on software development topics, but I will assume my reader (that's you! you're the best, I love you) doesn't know anything about it, but I will also assume that you can ignore the parts you don't really understand. The tech talk, if there is any, will either be simple enough for a layperson to understand, or it will be unimportant, and all you need to understand will be the parts that you CAN understand. (For example, when I say that blah-blah-blah is a lot of work, you don't need to know what blah-blah-blah means, all you need to know is that whatever it is, it's a lot of work, if that makes sense.)

So at work, I've been asked to do an extreme customization job on some software. Personally, I love customization -- or rather I really hate bad design and most software is really badly designed -- so I'm all over it.

The core of the issue is that this software can serve two different functions, but it's not great at doing them both at the same time. When I'm in Part1 of the software, it's really hard to show info from Part2; when I'm in Part2, it's basically impossible to use the same header/logo/menu bar as when you're in Part1. The result is what's called "spaghetti code" -- code that's just really messy and all over the place. It's very hard to maintain and understand.

The other part of the request is that, once I'm done building it, as much as possible, The Boss wants maintenance and updates to NOT be in the code itself; she wants to be able to use the
